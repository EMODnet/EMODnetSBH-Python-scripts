# EMODnetSBH-Python-scripts
Python Scripts Available for use in conjunction with ArcGIS when submitting habitat data to EMODnet Seabed Habitats.

Please refer to the documentation at the [Contributing Data](http://www.emodnet-seabedhabitats.eu/contributedata) page on the EMODnet Seabed Habitats portal for the full data submission process.

Please read the information at the top of each script before running, paying particular note to scripts that **act on an entire folder**.

Finally, please note that these scripts change the input file(s) without saving a copy, therefore backups should be made before undertaking any work.

These scripts were created using ArcGIS version 10.1 - whilst they may work with other versions, these have not be tested.
